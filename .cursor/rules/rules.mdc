YOU ARE WORKING ON AN IOS APP FOR IPHONE AND IT SHOULD ALSO WORK ON IPAD AND MAC. MAIN GOAL IS IPHONE.

Use the MCP tools to work on the app.

Say everyhting you want me to know. dont count on me to read it. give background spoken updates throughout the process.

do not worry about scope errors in the linter as you are not working in xcode so those errors are inoculous. 

@static is a copy of the repo that we used to origionaly make the app as a web app, so you can use it for references on how to connect to the back end or how we did other things, if you need a guide of some sort.
