# Product Requirements Document: Unified Design System

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating and implementing a unified design system for the Listener iOS application. The goal is to ensure a consistent and professional visual experience across all views and components of the app, improving usability and brand coherence.

## 2. Goals

*   **Visual Consistency:** Achieve a uniform look and feel across all screens and interactions.
*   **Improved User Experience (UX):** Provide a predictable and intuitive interface for users.
*   **Development Efficiency:** Streamline the design and development process with reusable components and styles.
*   **Brand Cohesion:** Reinforce the Listener brand identity through a consistent visual language.
*   **Scalability & Maintainability:** Create a design system that is easy to update, maintain, and scale as the app grows.

## 3. Scope

*   **Color Palette:** Define a primary, secondary, accent, and neutral color palette, including states (e.g., disabled, hover, pressed).
*   **Typography:** Specify font families, sizes, weights, and line heights for various text elements (headings, body text, captions, buttons).
*   **Iconography:** Select or design a consistent set of icons for common actions and information display.
*   **Layout & Spacing:** Establish standard spacing units, margins, paddings, and grid guidelines.
*   **Components:** Design and implement a library of reusable UI components, such as:
    *   Buttons (primary, secondary, tertiary, icon buttons)
    *   Cards (for displaying information, recordings, etc.)
    *   Navigation elements (tab bars, navigation bars)
    *   Input fields (text fields, sliders)
    *   List items
    *   Modals and Alerts
    *   Status indicators (e.g., for recording, transcribed, uploaded)
*   **Dark Mode Support:** Ensure all design elements and components are compatible with and optimized for dark mode.
*   **Accessibility:** Adhere to accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG) for color contrast and touch target sizes.

## 4. Target Users

*   End-users of the Listener application.
*   Developers and designers working on the Listener application.

## 5. Requirements

### 5.1. Core Styling Files

Create a dedicated `DesignSystem` directory within the project containing the following core Swift files:

*   `Theme.swift`: Global theme settings, potentially including light/dark mode configurations.
*   `Colors.swift`: Definitions for the application's color palette (e.g., `static let primaryBackground = Color("PrimaryBackgroundColor")`).
*   `Typography.swift`: Custom font styles, `Font` extensions, or `ViewModifier`s for applying consistent text styles.
*   `Components.swift`: A collection of reusable SwiftUI views or view modifiers for common UI elements (e.g., `PrimaryButton`, `StandardCard`).
*   `Spacing.swift`: Definitions for standard spacing values (e.g., `static let smallPadding: CGFloat = 8`).
*   `Icons.swift`: (Optional) Definitions for frequently used SFSymbols or custom icon assets.

### 5.2. Component Library

*   Develop a set of standardized, reusable SwiftUI components based on the defined styles.
*   Components should be configurable and adaptable to various contexts.
*   Components should handle different states (e.g., active, inactive, disabled, loading).

### 5.3. Documentation & Guidelines (Optional but Recommended)

*   Provide basic documentation or comments within the style files explaining usage.
*   Consider a simple style guide or component showcase in a separate document or preview view if feasible.

### 5.4. Implementation & Refactoring

*   Incrementally refactor existing views to adopt the new design system.
*   All new views and features must use the established design system.

## 6. Success Metrics

*   **Consistency Score:** (Qualitative) Visual audit showing a high degree of consistency across >90% of app screens.
*   **Development Speed:** (Qualitative/Quantitative) Reduction in time spent on UI styling and component creation for new features.
*   **User Feedback:** Positive feedback regarding app aesthetics and usability.
*   **Code Reusability:** Increased usage of shared style definitions and components.

## 7. Non-Goals

*   A complete redesign of the app's core functionality or information architecture.
*   Creation of an external, standalone design system library (initially).
*   Support for platforms other than iOS (iPhone, iPad, Mac Catalyst) at this stage.

## 8. Open Questions

*   What is the preferred primary font family?
*   Are there any existing brand guidelines to incorporate?
*   Specific list of initial components to prioritize.
